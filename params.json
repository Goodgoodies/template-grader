Well I thought it would be fun to make some scripts that run files for me. I can choose which files I would like to make, and what they should be called. Keep in mind that they just make some basic files.\r\n\r\n## How do I use it?\r\nQuick explanation?  \r\nClone the repoi\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/srepollock/template-grader ~/.templater` \r\n\r\nto the `~/.templater` file.\r\nNow set permissions to your `~/.templater/install.sh` with  \r\n\r\n`chmod a+x ~/.templater/install.sh`  \r\n\r\nAnd finally run `~/.tempalter/install.sh`  \r\n\r\n`~/.templater/install.sh`  \r\n\r\nThat's it? Yes!\r\n\r\n# Finally\r\nEverything should now be ready to run, just call `make_[filetype].sh` and everything should work great!\r\n> See [Wiki](https://github.com/srepollock/template-grader/wiki) for the file calls.\r\n> Or just run `templater_help.sh` for quick instructions.\r\n\r\n## Known Issue\r\n1. Cannot make a title for the HTML page more than one word.\r\n2. For Windows Git Bash, you must open a text editor as administrator and add:  \r\n\r\n        if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]\r\n        then\r\n            . ~/.bashrc\r\n        fi\r\n        \r\n",
  "note": "Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."
